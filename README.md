# Factors-Affecting-UK-Theme-Park-Attendance
This repository contains the code for an analysis I performed on factors affecting UK theme park attendance.

I performed an investigation into the relationship between UK theme park attendance and various extrinsic factors, with a key focus on the weather and the economy. The weather was found to not affect attendance to a statistically significant degree overall, with even the metric with the strongest-seeming relationship, rainfall, only showing spurious evidence of a causal relationship and exhibiting signs of a weak-to-insignificant correlation. The economy was found to have a far more significant effect, with CPI inflation rate and unemployment rate in particular exhibiting highly significant evidence of relationships and moderate-to-strong correlations. Interestingly, it was also found that perhaps unexpectedly, UK theme park attendance seems to be higher when economic strength is lower.

The various Python files contain scatter graphs comparing combined UK Merlin theme park attendance in a given year with a weather-based or socioeconomic factor, as well as a Pearson's correlation coefficient test confirming the strength of the correlation.

The CSV files contain the raw data for all years from 1997, years from 1997 excluding 2020 and years from 1997 excluding 2021.
