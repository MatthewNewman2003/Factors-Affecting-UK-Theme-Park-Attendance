# Factors-Affecting-UK-Theme-Park-Attendance
This repository contains the code for an analysis I performed on factors affecting UK theme park attendance.

The various Python files contain scatter graphs comparing combined UK Merlin theme park attendance in a given year with a weather-based or socioeconomic factor, as well as a Pearson's correlation coefficient test confirming the strength of the correlation.

The CSV files contain the raw data for all years from 1997, years from 1997 excluding 2020 and years from 1997 excluding 2021.

The analysis itself can be read here: https://coasterforce.com/forums/threads/uk-merlin-park-attendance-over-the-years.45840/#post-1159777
